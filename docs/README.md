### Setup

Install Miniconda and create a conda env:

`conda create -y -n env python=3.8`

Install dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


### Data

Data can be downloaded from the below links

1. [A tiny version of the dataset for debuggin purposes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tOxKetKwSB8Begw9t73KidWYqaI8QO0T/view?usp=sharing)
2. [Original](https://hatefulmemeschallenge.com/#about)

Unzip and place it under `data/` directory.

#### Fast Text Embeddings

Fasttext model can be trained by running `scripts/train_fasttext.py`. If run successfully, you will find a file called `text_embedding.bin` under `data/` directory.

`python train_fasttext.py --input data/hateful_memes/defaults/annotations/train.jsonl --output-dir data/`

#### Precomputed Features for UNITER Model

UNITER model uses precomputed region features for the hateful memes dataset extracted from a bottom up attention model trained on Visual Genome dataset. We have used [this](https://github.com/airsplay/py-bottom-up-attention) implementation of bottom up attention on top of Detectron2 to extract the region features. You can download the extracted region features for the model from [here](). 

### Training

If `python run.py` command is run, the default config in `config.yaml` is used for running the training expeirment. Specific experiments are configured under `configs/experiments` directory, which can be run as below:

#### Concat Fasttext

`python run.py experiment=concat_fasttext datamodule.num_workers=12 datamodule.batch_size=256`

#### Concat BERT

`python run.py experiment=concat_bert datamodule.num_workers=12 datamodule.batch_size=256`

### References

1. `ConcatModel` is based on the baseline provided by DrivenData [here](https://www.drivendata.co/blog/hateful-memes-benchmark/).
